I'm an aspiring Data Analyst and Data Scientist, currently on an epic journey to go from zero to hero in the data field. Driven by curiosity, I thrive on the power of data to tell stories and solve real-world problems. 

## 🔭 What I'm Working On
- 🌱 **Learning**: Mastering SQL, Python, and machine learning concepts. Currently diving into MySQL Workbench for SQL practice.
- 📝 **Project**: Building a portfolio website to showcase my data analysis projects and notes.
- 🛠 **Tech Stack**: [Consider listing languages, tools, and frameworks you’re comfortable with or learning, like Python, SQL, MySQL, AHK, etc.]

## 💼 Experience & Skills
I’m working my way through data analysis essentials like:
- **SQL**: Aliases, Joins, and Error Handling
- **AutoHotkey (AHK)**: For automating tasks on Windows, including MySQL Workbench tricks!
- **IT Projects**: From setting up Raspberry Pi-powered tools to experimenting with Proxmox.

## 🤖 Goals
