# Hello World 
## (2nd. Renaissance) 2025-01-23

- 👋 Hi, I’m A.DAL
- 👀 I’m interested in going from data-zero to data-hero, with skills in SQL, Python, and beyond!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced SQL and building my portfolio in data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that need data-crunching and insight-building.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I treat data analysis like cooking: gather the ingredients (data), follow the recipe (code), and add a pinch of creativity for the perfect flavour of insight! 👨‍🍳📊
